# time_series

This is the repo for the winter 2024 DDSC project, co-led by Dave Wang and Kevin Gui. 
Time series is an important subset of data science essentially all companies need. Predicting demand, forecasting trends, evaluating future risks are a few examples where time series forecasting may apply.
In our project, we will predict the monthly traffic (passenger count) for the San Francisco International Airport.
Exploratory data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning models are for us to explore.
